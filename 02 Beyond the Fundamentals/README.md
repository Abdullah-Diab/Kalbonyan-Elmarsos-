### Course Notes.

- **Collections** are a grouping of multiple items together and storing them with a single name, called a variable.

- **A list** is a Simple collection that groups pieces of data together in a certain order and assigns the collection a name.
  ```python
  guests = ['Abdullah', 'Mohamed', 'Diab']
  ```
- **Dictionary** let you store related information but with a label for each item.
  ```python
  food = {
  	'appetizer': 'hummus',
  	'dessert': 'ricotta',
  	'entree': 'gyro wraps',
     	}
  ```
- **Python**: collections can contain any data type and are mutable as they can be changed after creating.

- **C++**: collection should contain the same data type.

- **Iteration** repeats the same procedure multiple times until it reaches a specified endpoint.

- **Loop** code that iterates, moving from beginning to end of the process.

- **An infinite loop** is a bug that can occur when the ending condition is omitted or specified incorrectly.

- **Iterating through collections**

  - `for` specific variable names that we can use in each iteration of the loop to reference the current values.

  - `in` indicating what follows is the set of values we want to iterate through.

  ```python
  spices = ['pepper', 'salt', 'garlic', 'cumin']

  for spice in spices:

      print(spice)
  ```

  - `while` used to create a loop in python.

  ```python
  # print count to 100 by 5
  i = 5
  while i <= 100:
      print(i)
      1 += 5
      print('List completed')
  ```

- **Module** python file that contains code, like variables or functions.

- **Library or package** using multiple modules together so they are distributed and used in a group.

- **The framework** is when a set of codes is not just used together but used in a specific way.

- **Strings** are collections of characters assembled together in a specific way.

- **Concatenation** is when multiple strings are combined into a single string.

- **Python String Methods :** `.capitalize()` , `.find()` , **Slicing `[start:end]` :** Getting part of a string value.

- **Regular expressions** **(Regex)** allow you to create a description of a pattern that you want to match.

- **Pseudocode** is writing a description of what you are trying to do using plain language.

- **Debugging** is identifying and fixing bugs.

- **Syntax Error** Code that doesn't match the rules of the language.

- **Run-time Error** calls a function before defining it.

- **Logic Error c**ode that runs but doesn't produce the result you expect.
