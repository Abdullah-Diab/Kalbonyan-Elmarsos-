### Course Notes.

- **What is programming?** Programming is the process of converting ideas into instructions that a computer can understand and execute. These instructions are specific and sequential.

- **In Programming, A bug** is when something unexpected happens.

- **In Programming, A crash** is when your programming stops early or freezes.

- **What is a programming language?** When you want to provide instructions to a computer, you use what's called a programming language. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of programming languages available, each made up of its own syntax, rules, semantics, or meaning.

- **Why not just have one programming language and we all use it?** The main reason why we have so many languages is that each comes with its own set of strengths and weaknesses.

- **Writing source code is what programmers do all day.**

- **There are three main ways to translate source code into machine code:** compile it, interpret it, or a combination of both.

- **Compiled languages:** C, C++, and Objective-C.

- **Interpretive languages:** PHP and JavaScript.

- **Combination languages:** Java, C#, and Python.

- **IDE:** Integrated Development Environments.

- **Statements** are the building blocks of any program and are the individual actions that you want your program to take. Without statements, there's no program.

- **Each statement can be made up of** keywords, expressions, and operators.

- **Operators** are symbols that tell the computer to perform an action with some input.

- **Errors Categories:**

  - **Syntax** - Language rules are broken.
  - **Runtime** - Unable to execute.
  - **Semantic** - Unexpected output.

- **A variable** is simply a container for a value. When we run our programs, the computer gives us space in its memory where we can put data that we want to use as a reference for later. This data is called a variable.

- **A data type** allows us to put our variable in a particular category so that the computer knows how much space to give us in its memory.

- **Boolean expression:** Any expression that breaks down to either true or false.

- **Relational operators:** work with two operands, and they return a value, true or false, based on their relation to each.

- **Equality operator:** It's represented by a double equal sign, and it's used to evaluate the equality of the operands.

- **A function** is a block of code packaged together with a name.

- **Java, Python, and C++** have inherited ideas from C.

- **The C programming language** was developed in the 1970s. It's used for programming operating systems, games, smart devices, and even compilers for other languages.

- **A library** is the grouping of variables and functions that someone else has written and verified.
